					Three tools for web tests, high in the sky,<br />
					Selenium, Puppeteer, and Cypress—oh my!<br />
					Five for WebDriver and Playwright’s might,<br />
					Their scripts executing deep in the night,<br />
					One for the mobile, where apps crawl,<br />
					In the realm of devices, where tests must sprawl.<br />
					One tool to rule them all, one tool to bind,<br />
					Appium, the mighty, none left behind,<br />
					In the realm of testing, where shadows lie,<br />
					Automate it all, or at least we’ll try!<br />

					Whatever we learn to do, we learn by actually doing it; men come to be builders, for instance, by building, and harp players by playing the harp. In the same way, by doing just acts we come to be just; by doing self-controlled acts, we come to be self-controlled ; and by doing brave acts, we become brave.<br />

					Hard work will not ensure quality.<br />
					Best efforts will not ensure quality, and neither will gadgets, computers or investment in machinery.<br />
					A necessary ingredient for improvement of quality is the application of profound knowledge.<br />
					There is no substitute for knowledge. Knowledge we have in abundance. We must learn to use it.<br />
